# Object-detection
## Our task of machine learning model 

The machine learning model is aimed at solving the task of object detection. This involves identifying and localizing various objects within images. The model leverages a MobileNet architecture, known for its efficiency, especially on mobile devices. The COCO dataset, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, is used for training and evaluation

when we insert the video clip into the object detection model it identifies the objects that have in the videos like persons, vehicles, and others. and also this model provides  the web camera and captures the objects of the nature.   




## Final outcome of the object detection model

when we insert to the video clips, model captures the different types of objects of the videos
when we insert to pictures into the model,The model identify the which types of objects of the pictures. 
This object model captures the objects of the nature, when we open the web camera of the devices
